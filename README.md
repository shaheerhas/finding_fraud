# finding_fraud
Machine Learning model to find fraudulent people.
From my analysis, SOURCE column of the transaction.csv fileis responsible most for determining the fraudulent people. 
Another thing is that all the 10 new fraudsters which I have identified, are from GB.
The second feature would be the merchant_country. It has a great effect on the predictions too, followed by Entry_method.
